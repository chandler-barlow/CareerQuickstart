## What are the typical career paths for a software engineer?
That's a hard question to answer. There are countless different career paths for a prospective software engineer to choose from. Luckily a majority of entry level software jobs follow several patterns and utilize similar tools. Not all jobs with these titles are the *same* but they are similar enough that it makes sense for them to share a title. In fact many of the jobs postings you will encounter will be using different tools than the ones I reccomend here. Don't be alarmed, despite the tools being different the concepts are largely the same. Learning the tools and concepts I outline further down will still be enough to get you an interview. Most companies care about the *concepts* used to build software not the language, platform, or tools used. As you get your footing in the industry you will inevitably specialize. As you specialize the tools do start to matter more, but for now just focus on getting strong with the basics.  

Most companies that build software are building software that interacts with the internet somehow. Building this software is called *web development*. In general there are two major specializations in web development.

## Frontend Development
Frontend development is any software development work related to constructing the views that the end user sees. A frontend developer is responsible for creating the application interface ( GUI ). Bing a frontend developer requires working close with designers. The designers build out screens in some kind of image editing software and hand it off to the frontend developer. The frontend developer is then responsible for bulding the GUI to spec with the designers vision. Often several choices made by the designers are simply not possible, either due to time constraints or technical limitations. As the frontend developer you are responsible for meeting with the desiginer and brainstorming possible ways to achieve their vision despite limitations.

#### Good frontend developers are
###### Excited by the idea of thousands of people interacting with the product they built.
The best frontend devs I have met are user focused. They generally are empathetic with their users. They imagine how their user will feel as they use the product they are building. A truly good frontend developer knows when to push back on management about bad design choices. After time they know what kind of UI will be easy to understand for new users. They also know what kind of UI the business *thinks* they want, but will inevitably have to change weeks later ( this is common and you learn to catch it ).
###### Creative people. You enjoy visual problem solving and brainstorming interesting designs.
Frontend is all about the experience of a user. Most of your time is spent crafting an engaging user experience. You are the most valuable when you are able to express the goals of an application in unique ways.
###### Able to move quickly and comfortable with change.
The GUI of an application is the way that a business communicates with their customers. The only constant with consumer messaging is that businesses are always tweaking it. Being a frontend developer requires being comfortable with constant iteration. The frontend reacts to the requirements of its users. As the needs of the users change, and the goals of the business, the GUI must change as well.
###### Enjoy honing their craft. The frontend changes rapidly with new tech or design principles.
Because the way businesses like to design applications is changing frequently, I'm sure you can imagine that the tools used change as well. The concepts stay the same but more than most fields the ways people build software seems to be in constant flux. This is a challenging invigorating process, but can tire out people not truly interested in design.

#### The tools of a frontend developer

###### HTML
This is the bones of any web application. HTML is used to structure content on a webpage.
###### CSS
This is the language used to style the content on a page. Where HTML might be the actual text on screen, CSS tells the browser what color, size, or font to use.
###### Javascript
Javascript is the king of the internet. If you want to make a page interactive you will be writing javascript. This isn't really an option at the moment and you are best off just learning it. This is a general purpose dynamically typed scripting language used to change, update or add interactive content on a webpage.
###### React
This one is a bit more complex. This is a javascript framework. With react you can generate dynamic HTML and CSS at runtime. This leads to more interactive and dynamic applications than just vanilla Javascript, CSS, and HTML. React is the most commonly used frontend tool in the world at the moment. This will be the final piece to learn when shooting for a frontend job. *Learn Javascript, HTML, and CSS first!* React is full of more advanced application development concepts that will be confusing if it's the first place you start. The framework also uses HTMl, CSS, an Javascript extensively. Logically you do not want to start at the most complicated point and work your way back through its constituent parts.
##### APIs and requests
Learn to not only what an API is, but how to interact with one. At a high level APIs are a way to interact with a different application purely through code. Generally the frontend is just the definition of how an application works. An application still needs something to keep track of users, data, etc. This generally is done by making a connection to a seperate second application on a server somewhere. The method for making this connection is an API. *APIs constitute the backend of an application. This is explained in the next section*
